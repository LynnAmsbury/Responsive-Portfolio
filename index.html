        <p>Hi! I'm Lynn, a Denver metropolitan-area website developer-in-training! I'm sure that at some point this
          project will become an actual portfolio site to showcase all of the things we have done in this coding boot
          camp (and maybe some things we have done on our own, if we have), and this introductory paragraph should
          explain what my areas of greatest interest and expertise are. However, for the time being I'm a student of
          website development and a very new one at that, and I don't know what my areas of greatest interest and
          expertise are yet. I'll update this as I figure them out. I have had a lot of fun with this project, though,
          so maybe front-end and user interface will become areas I focus on.</p>
          <p>Oh - and I like cats. A lot.</p>
